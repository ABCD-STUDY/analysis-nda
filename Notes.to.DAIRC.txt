#generate non_image RDS (in this order)
data_merge_nda.3.0.R -> core_demographics3.0.R -> categorical_extension3.0.R -> merge.additional.variables.R


#generate image_1 and image_2 RDS (in this order)
data_merge_nda.3.0.R -> categorical_extension3.0.R

#Remember to change variable type accordingly in R code: 
when merge non_image: type="non_image"; 
when merge image_1: type="image_1"; 
when merge image_2, type="image_2"


#final dimensions of the 3 RDS:
non_image:54594 14740 
image_1:18449 29042 (baseline and 2 year  only)
image_2:18449 26606 (baseline and 2 year  only)

#total columns if further merging the 3 RDS
#14740+29042+26606-12=70376 

#abcd_lt01 (longitudinal track)is merged into all 3 RDS, so there are shared variables across 3 RDS:
"src_subject_id" "eventname"      "interview_date" "interview_age"  "sex" "site_id_l" 

Use non_image as anchor to merge further, by "src_subject_id" and "eventname" 
Remove "interview_date" "interview_age"  "sex" "site_id_l" from image_1 and image_2 before merge

#All the data used are here:
./SYNC/abcd_3.0_imaging_tabulated_1
./SYNC/abcd_3.0_imaging_tabulated_2
./SYNC/ABCD_3.0_non_imaging_tabulated

#in case of re-merging, use the updated table(s) to replace the current table(s). Be careful, there is slight difference of format between  non-imaging tables
#and imaging tables (just go to open any one from both categories, you will see. Non-imaging tables, the first row is discharged during merging in my R code; 
#imaging table, first row is fine.

#error in tables have been cleaned up (even some are still here, you will see the correction in R code during merge).
#abcd_fbwpas01 and abcd_fbwss01 in ./SYNC/ABCD_3.0_non_imaging_tabulated are the wide-format already
