### A collection of analysis scripts for NDA-17

The NDA-17 interim data release contains data for the first 4,524 participants of the Adolescent Brain, Cognitive Development study. This project summarizes some of the scripts developed at ABCD's Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC, UC San Diego).

The data for this release can be downloaded from NDA using a pre-generated package "ABCD-RELEASE-1" using the Download Manager tool provided by NDA. Place the data into the data folder of this project.
