### A collection of analysis scripts for NDA-17

The NDA-17 interim data release contains data for the first 4,524 participants of the Adolescent Brain, Cognitive Development study. This repository contains a collection of scripts developed at ABCD's Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC, UC San Diego) to process data that is part of the first public interim data release of ABCD.

The data for this release can be downloaded from NDA using a pre-generated package "ABCD-RELEASE-1" using the Download Manager tool provided by NDA. Place the data into the data folder of this project.

 - [Merge individual spreadsheets (using R)](notebooks/general/merge_data.md)

 - [Recode some core demographic variables (using R)](notebooks/derived/core_demographics.md)
 - [Merge individual data dictionaries (using R)](notebooks/general/merge_data_dictionaries.md)

Let us know if you have a script that you think should be part of this project.
