Definition of convenience variables
Most of these are simple re-definitions of existing columns with simplier names, other columns are re-scored versions of nda18 columns.

Start by reading in the merged data from disk.
```{r}
script.dir <- "~/Desktop/ABCD/analysis-nda18/notebooks/general/"
setwd(script.dir)

nda18 = readRDS("nda2.0.1_orig.Rds")



#The site_name is anonymized and stored per event in case participants move from one site to another during the study.
nda18$abcd_site = nda18$site_id_l #site_id_l is in longitudianl tracking instrument


### Subjectid
nda18$subjectid = nda18$src_subject_id


### Age (in month)
nda18$age = nda18$interview_age

##NDA used to using "gender" as "sex at birth"; rename it as "sex" and reset empty as NA;

### Household income
household.income = nda18$demo_comb_income_p

### Marrital status

### Body-Mass index, remove outlier >36 or < 11 based on the recommendation from Rebecca Umbach, PhD.
nda18$anthro_bmi_calc = as.numeric(as.character(nda18$anthro_weight_calc)) / as.numeric(as.character(nda18$anthro_height_calc))^2 * 703
